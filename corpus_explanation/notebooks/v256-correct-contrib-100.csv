24701,my first <unk> of the <unk>  live action movie trailer  viewable on youtube   was  wow  this could be perhaps one of the few better live  action anime adaptations    this time i was just wrong  simply put  the live  action <unk> movie was a puzzle missing a number of pieces  put together just enough to get the vague image of it        the movies story vaguely follows the anime and manga  but the movies story is just the frame of a car  rather than a complete automobile  it seems that many parts of the story originally in the anime were left out  altered  or completely changed  in fact the ending is completely different from the manga or anime endings     characters especially  many left out or had a different feel  the connection between <unk> and <unk> is reduced to that of <unk> knowing her because she  the video store lady  <unk>  character felt too strong already and only uttered the infamous i  sorry a few times in the movie  same can be said with <unk>  we lost the shy uptight yet tall male lead  the song he hums  and his frequent action of calling <unk> silly  other characters like <unk> and <unk> had a different  toned down feel to them  perhaps the dropping and toning down of other characters was to focus a lot more on <unk> and <unk>  which it did  way too much  expecting a lot of sweet action scenes like those in the trailer  well do   those in the trailer plus a few minutes  is the only amount of action you will get  so much of the movie is talking that while i was owsing thru the movie before watching it all  i thought i had gotten a regular asian romance drama     pacing was way too fast  in the film  we see the famous scene of <unk> armed with small wings and a chain gun arm  in just a little less than nine minutes of beginning it  there is very little time to get to know the characters and connect with them  what they should have done was split it into two movies  or even a trilogy  if it had been not as many things would have to be changed or   but again the movie behaves like a frame  the anime was more of a complete automobile because even if all those little details and such are minor they can really add      visuals were disappointing  so much of the special effects turned out looking quite cheesy especially the cgi  sadly  they were like those found on sci  fi channel movies  they are bearable and this movie is  for the    music was average  much of it was orchestral background music except there were really no themes  the film has dropped the addicting song that <unk> in the anime was always humming  a noticeable piece of music though is the ending song  heard in the trailer  not a bad and somewhat beautiful song  its a shame that it was not integrated into the movie as itself or an orchestrated version of the    <unk>  casting was also so  so  the main star was <unk> actor aki maeda  who is most famous for her role in the battle royale films  the actor that played <unk> was pretty good but they took away the glasses from the original character  oh yeah and tetsuo looks like lupin the   unlike what i  heard from a few others  the acting in the live  action <unk> was not that bad  i rather feel at fault is the way the story was laid out and cramming the series into just a two  hour    can be learned from the live action    i really wish the cgi in <unk> had  been that bad  but even with just that  we could have gotten a few more fight scenes  probably the most anticipated live  action anime adaptation neon genesis evangelion most likely wo nt suffer since they currently have weta studios assigned to do the    <unk> owned a video shop  <unk> used a audio cassette player to listen to music and gave <unk> a mix tape for his birthday  why  this movie is made in   not only that in the movies reality they can create such a thing as <unk> so it can not take place in the   the future is an age of cds  dvds  and  players  hopefully in evangelion  shinji will have a sony walkman  player  not one that plays cassette      as mentioned earlier  the <unk> movie moved too fast and forced the story to drop out many details  it was a smart move upon adv films and whoever else  to make evangelion into a solid trilogy thus allowing more time to retell the story as true to the original as    leave most of the character designs alone and let those classic quotes be said  what if the live action evangelion did  have asuka   what are you  stupid    or shinji   i must  run away   sometimes as small as they seem  those frequent quotes add and are who the characters     all in all  the live action <unk> movie had potential  it really did  those you who are  fans and see this movie  you will be reluctant to start the anime or manga  so do  watch the movie first   people who saw and liked the anime  manga  do  get your hopes up on this one  studies show you most likely will be disappointed  it was still fun to see the anime come to life in the
