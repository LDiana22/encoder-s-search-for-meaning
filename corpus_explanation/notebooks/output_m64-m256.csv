11,22524,this is among one of many usa attempts of remaking a old classic itish tv show  that  more famous than this one  from what i see none of you have  mentioned or even acknowledged that you knew there was a tv   called  secret agent man  the original secret agent man starred the great patrick mcgoohan  the prisoner  aveheart  ice station zea  the phantom  etc  a man who was tapped to be the first james bond  but he turned it down because mcgoohan was a very devout man and he considered james bond  bed hopping and violent ways to be against his   this show was done in black and white  and it  a pity for those who have  seen it  you are missing out on a lot  the character  mcgoohan played in  secret agent man  was named drake  and after he finished with that show he went on to the do the very popular though at times bizarre and controversial tv series called  the prisoner   the character he played in  the prisoner  was that of a agent who  identity is not revealed is kidnapped and transported to a island where he does not know where he is or who it was that is responsible for kidnapping him  what he does know is that his captors want to know the reasons behind his resignation from the itish secret service  and on this island the populace do  have names but they are referred to by numbers and <unk> character is assigned a number which is    it was argued that his prisoner character was in fact the same character he played in secret agent man but mcgoohan himself disputed   <unk> there is the unmistakable famous theme song that the original secret agent man spawned  it was written by johnny rivers a famous   and   pop musician and from what i read some of you are actually think that the song comes from this version of the show  you  very wrong about that  it was johnny  and it comes from the original tv series so let me help to set the facts straight  to those of you who complained about the name of the show being stupid  well in england  it was actually called  danger man  and in the us it was retitled  secret agent man  for such a supposedly stupid name the show did well enough when it was first   granted this current show has little to do with the original  no such main character named drake in this one  and i guess they did their best to make this show their version of  secret agent man   but it does use the redone version of the original theme song so that does tell you that this show was indeed meant to be a redone albeit however inferior redone version of the original series  <pad> <pad> <pad> ,one honest movie goer,0.13810056447982788,1,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.3208,0.018020622432231903,0.13810056447982788,king give impressive performances,0.0043531060218811035,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.8613,0.9575952291488647,0.0043531060218811035
35,17135,as social satire  idiocracy is just as good as office space  but with a wider scope  to criticize this film as too puerile due to potty humor is to kind of miss the point  i think  there are certainly fart jokes etc   but they  not really intended to be funny to the audience  they exist to define the state of  culture  in the world of  ad visited by joe  as a background to the bizarre state of affairs in which he awakes  the real humor of the film lies in the many sight gags and attitudes present in this future society that are just a shade off of what we encounter in our daily lives  and which should serve as a warning  my personal favorite is the depiction of fox news  the subtle illiance in the film lies in the fact that it also digs at  smart  people  and average joes like the protagonists  note the times in the film when joe and rita almost subconsciously conform to the idiots around them  and you realize that idiocracy is not created to pick on any group of people in particular  but on the culture of idiocy in general  i do  know what to say about the  made for conspiracy theory  behavior of fox in releasing this film  but if it  not playing in your local theater  demand it  we all need to see this film  if not for the social commentary  at least for the fart jokes  ,positively roast every scene,0.13707828521728516,1,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.5861,0.26767060160636896,-0.13707828521728516,respectable affluent rich america,0.05425167083740234,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.794,0.9792305827140808,-0.05425167083740234
37,22053,maybe being a government bureaucrat is not the most glamorous way of making a living but it  still a way to make a living  however  after watching this movie  one may come away believing that every government bureaucrat is a lazy  bloated  conceited  paper pusher who lives exclusively to partake of his next lunch eak  not exactly a pretty picture  but this is the picture that the audience has to endure when watching what is nothing more than another tedious  noisy  overacted action movie  just what the doctor ordered  right  how many more of these movies has hollywood made  one thousand  two thousand  the formula for making these movies is so beaten into the dust that by now it should be completely unrecognizable  the locales change but the plots remain the same  and with the same shallow character development and the equally shallow acting as trained performers are asked to devolve into pseudo  cartoon characters and act accordingly  this movie seemed to run  on interminably   when will this movie end   i repeatedly thought to myself  leonardo dicaprio was totally unbelievable as a cia operative  but what has to be one of the great <unk> of miscasting  an overweight russell crowe plays a cia bureaucrat  please note that in this movie the on site operative is  lean and mean  while his desk jockey supervisor is fat  this is called stereotyping  what was the casting director thinking  why not have jack nicholson play an overweight office clerk  or nicole kidman play a frumpy department store saleswoman  and the story was so fantastic that no amount of literary license could afford it credibility  an obviously non  arab american   dicaprio  trying to pass himself off as an arab  speaking fluent arabic  concocting all kinds of hair ain schemes that are doomed to failure  trying to out think and <unk> real arabs who are completely <unk> by his laughable arab masquerade  trying to romance a palestinian woman while in the middle of conducting a highly sensitive and complex espionage mission  etc  by now you get the point  next time try casting an actual arab in the role  not even the most naive movie goer can believe all that  there should be a rough balance between the protagonist and antagonist  in this movie the protagonist is so transparent and incompetent that it leaves the story in shambles  next stop for this movie  dvd land and oblivion  and one other thing   let this movie discourage you from working for the government  the pay may not be great  but the fringe benefits are excellent  a critical fact that this movie conveniently omits  ,stupid slasher movies push,0.13235360383987427,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.8159,0.7186707258224487,0.13235360383987427,wide white ready grin,0.0711396336555481,1,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.3187,0.9753942489624025,0.0711396336555481
