0,12830,the only reason i watched this movie a second time  was to learn the name of the  second banana  girl playing opposite katie <unk>  her name is marisa <unk>  never heard of her before  she is lovely  captivating  with an animated face  and cute bod  she is highly watchable  she  got real   <unk>   more than a passing vibe of grace kelly  with youthful exuberance  i think she is irish in gene pool   my favorite female dna  so it makes some sense that she would resemble the most beautiful irish american  the movie is unremarkable  katie <unk> is classic beauty in the flesh  but marisa <unk> is the one you follow with your eyes  in  when this movie was made  she was around  years old  in her prime  this reminds me of another silly  worthless movie with the only redemption being the pretty girl in it  it was  career <unk>  with the first time i saw jennifer <unk>  or  grease ii  the first time i saw michelle pfeiffer  <pad> ,another great orchestral score,0.033433109521865845,1,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.336,0.17766880989074707,0.033433109521865845,respectable affluent rich america,0.026427388191223145,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.6218,0.9956436157226562,0.026427388191223145,0,0
1,14260,paul naschy as a ghostly security guard in this is scarier than most of his fur  and  shoe  polish werewolf guises  the story is not unfamiliar  a bunch of kids going to party at an abandoned school  the thing is  that one of these kid  fathers did the same thing years ago but he  now deceased  and the latest group of kids seem to be reliving an event from  years ago  this is fairly well done for films of this type  and there  an air of mystery to what  going on because apparently what happened to the kids before is somewhat of a mystery and perhaps the truth was  revealed  so no  not just your standard slice and dice  this moves along at a fairly good clip and does  let you lose interest like a lot of films do  and the oddball story is compelling enough to keep you interested too  and there  some suspense which is lacking in a lot of films these days  the ending is rather aupt and i suppose is left mostly to your imagination  but then again it does  out  stay its welcome either   out of   check it out  ,great films get better,0.11365075409412385,1,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.1848,0.1184522733092308,-0.11365075409412385,leslie still look great,0.05208098888397217,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.7623,0.9815350770950316,-0.05208098888397217,0,0
2,16181,there is a lot to like in this film  despite its humble trappings of a preachy pc tale about rape and the perp always faring better than the victim  the movie did create a fair bit of suspense in the mystery surrounding who was sending the notes   i  for one  was sure it was the teacher  in fact  that would have been more probable plot  wise because the idea of the best  friend  boy  friend kind of came out of nowhere  i guess the point of that is that  rape is omnipresent  you never know who it is going to be     <unk> is luminous as always  yet see <unk> discussion board for my qualification of this statement   like all preachy films the plot lasts  minutes past the climax so you might want to quit watching at that point  unless you are really curious to find out what happens to phillip  blythe danner  as the mom  is in the role she was born to play  the fretting  over  protective mom  some good  scenes for  fans   the dark bar that the father goes to in order to drink away his pain is all dark  stained beams  barrels  oak and cork   a must for <unk> fans and highly recommended for fans of  high school melodrama or  kitsch in general  ,anyone could easily enjoy,0.1012239307165146,1,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.3442,0.228378564119339,-0.1012239307165146,anyone could easily enjoy,0.11380863189697266,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.7312,0.97587388753891,-0.11380863189697266,0,0

4,17135,as social satire  idiocracy is just as good as office space  but with a wider scope  to criticize this film as too puerile due to potty humor is to kind of miss the point  i think  there are certainly fart jokes etc   but they  not really intended to be funny to the audience  they exist to define the state of  culture  in the world of  ad visited by joe  as a background to the bizarre state of affairs in which he awakes  the real humor of the film lies in the many sight gags and attitudes present in this future society that are just a shade off of what we encounter in our daily lives  and which should serve as a warning  my personal favorite is the depiction of fox news  the subtle illiance in the film lies in the fact that it also digs at  smart  people  and average joes like the protagonists  note the times in the film when joe and rita almost subconsciously conform to the idiots around them  and you realize that idiocracy is not created to pick on any group of people in particular  but on the culture of idiocy in general  i do  know what to say about the  made for conspiracy theory  behavior of fox in releasing this film  but if it  not playing in your local theater  demand it  we all need to see this film  if not for the social commentary  at least for the fart jokes  ,positively roast every scene,0.13707828521728516,1,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.5861,0.26767060160636896,-0.13707828521728516,respectable affluent rich america,0.05425167083740234,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.794,0.9792305827140808,-0.05425167083740234,0,0
5,17999,i was just looking at the  bottom movies according to imdb users seeing if there was anything to review that i have  yet and i found this little screen gem  one of those occasions when you see a movie ranked as one of the worst and you just have to be one of the few that actually likes it  darn  well i guess i will get ridiculed and spat upon here  but for me this was a pretty good flick when i saw it  it has been awhile however  i remember it used to come on hbo late at night and i watched it two or three times and i have  seen it really since and i would love to watch it again now knowing jolie was in it  the story follows a cyborg and a guy trying to escape the clutches of this corporation and some bounty hunters after them  i think that is basically all there is to it  throw in a few scenes with jack palance and we have our movie  some good action here and there  and some blood and violence as well  there is also a love story at play as well as the female cyborg and the guy who trained her to fight kind of fall in love with each other  the dialog sometimes becomes rather bad at times and it is by far not a top notch film  but for a b  movie it is really good  i do  know if it was a theatrical release though because it does not seem high quality enough for that  but it does make for one of the better direct to videos if it was one of those  ,cold war tension portrayed,0.05200904607772827,1,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.4173,0.2287396639585495,-0.05200904607772827,respectable affluent rich america,0.09617561101913452,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.7029,0.9680057168006896,-0.09617561101913452,1,0

8,24500, i am  proud of  head    mike nesmith has said  he should be  because this film  which either has been derided by many of us or studied and scrutinized by film professors  works on many   yes  it  unconventional  to many  frustrating  it  almost as if the producers hand you the film and tempt   you figure it out    you probably already know that the monkees tv show was a runaway marketing success that depended upon business acumen and no small serving of public deception  tv shows are about selling soap and toothpaste first  than to entertain  that the monkees oke out of the box for a short time to make  head  is a testament to the group  popularity and importance in pop culture  despite where your head  at  get one thing straight   head  is not the monkees tv   so what we have here is a  psychedelic documentary  about western pop culture from a source that has authority on the subject   head  is a movie that could only come from those  inside the box   by   the monkees  cast and crew were seasoned and weary professionals who had seen their share of promise and disappointment  the movie was a deliberate attempt at market <unk>  so  it did three things  make a film the way the monkees envisioned  most importantly  reinvent the group to one not subservient to it  old bosses  and yas  hipper than before  make a film that exposed american attitudes of information      therefore  really is about media manipulation and its net result  deception  the mass media is supposed to inform  educate us on the happenings in the world at large  and ultimately asks us to form opinions of these events that can shape thought into positive action  thus we assume the information we absorb to be complete and unbiased  otherwise  how can one establish a valued conclusion on any one idea presented by a book  newspaper or tv show  in one of the street interviews in  head   a guy admits   i have  looked at a newspaper or tv in years   is he lesser or better the man  even the drug parallels are a soft <unk> of  things are not as they seem   remember the old joke   everything you know is wrong   the screenplay starts with the monkees  public admission of it  own  manufactured image  and runs with the football  literally  is the football scene in the movie a visual manifestation of the whole idea behind  head   is the film a stream  of  consciousness exercise  is the film the culmination of pot smoking marathons  there are too many coincidences that occur in the film that suggest otherwise  my guess is that  head  is the culmination of motivations somewhere between intended and   largely  the insiders responsible for  head  seem to enjoy themselves in the <unk> that take place in the film  but there is anger  anger at the chaos that characterized the late   and anger at the way the media  television especially  had changed culture in negative ways  drugs and violence were strong negative forces in the late   and still are  but the producers of  head  want you to know that poor  information  is a far greater   wars have been attributed to <unk> and lies  what perfect way to spread disinformation than through tv  repeatedly  the mysterious black box is seen as an obstacle to the monkees and seemingly  all of us as well  in one scene  peter is sullenly sitting in a saloon holding a melting ice cream cone  and is asked by a fellow monkey   what  wrong    i bought this ice cream cone and i do  want it   the movie suggests that the first purpose of the media is not to inform  but to sell en mass blindly   head  goes further  put any idea into someone  head  and merrily goes   the filmmakers know this  and the danger is real   head  is either a movie that creates itself  as we go along   or is a deliberate statement  perhaps  perhaps not  maybe it is just  pot meets advertising   as critics scathed in   the jokes are on the monkees and us  be careful what you ask for  you may get   cheers  a true guilty pleasure  very funny  intelligent  will please the fans  find the substance  it  there  unabashedly weird  bizarre collection of characters  good <unk>  length is appropriate  lots of great one liners  including my all time prophetic favorite   the tragedy of your times  my young friends  is that you may get exactly what you want    caveats  dated  drugs  no plot  no linear delivery of any thought in particular  at least twenty  five stories that <unk> in stop   go fashion  so  may easily frustrate  may seem pretentious to some  people who ca  stand the monkees need not watch  though that in itself is no reason to avoid it  the psychedelic special effects may kill your ailing picture tube or your acid  out   match  cut  ,excellent movies ever produced,0.10355663299560547,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.9633,0.6351852416992188,-0.10355663299560547,excellent movies ever produced,0.07794623076915741,1,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.2178,0.9948068261146544,-0.07794623076915741,0,0

13,19032,well  i guess i was in the mood for a movie that really grabbed me from the beginning  this movie was  it  it plodded along at a pretty slow  deliberate pace for the first  minutes  but there was  really anything in it that i was terribly interested in  there  an intriguing and mysterious feud between jean reno  character and an old man  but more of the first  minutes is dominated by the wanderings of the main character  whom i did  know much about and could  really relate to at the time  he wanders around alone for the most part  he does  meet anyone  i imagine the director was trying to depict the loneliness of the human condition in this post  apocalyptic world or something  which is all good  but i still wish he  trimmed it down from  minutes to   because it can get incredibly   but after those  minutes  things start to get very interesting  i guess i wo  really say more than that because i do  want to spoil anything  so if you  seen the first    minutes of this movie and are thinking about turning it off  like i was   just stick with it  it gets a lot   one of the most interesting things i found about this movie was the fact that it had no dialogue whatsoever  which really made me have to think about what was happening  how characters were feeling and what their motivations were  why things were how they were in this post  apocalyptic world  all of which gives the story a lot of room for audience interpretation  and it  amazing how much more satisfying a movie is when the actors are  telling you exactly what  going on  ,pulitzer prize winning play,0.032298147678375244,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.9144,0.2432359904050827,-0.032298147678375244,pulitzer prize winning play,0.031508773565292365,1,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.4746,0.9918266534805298,-0.031508773565292365,0,0

67,20960,for the main criticisms of the movie  the love story  that was  a love story  those were two people distraught coming together trying to find humanity in anyone  the same thing happened with soldiers and the russian boy  it added a feminine touch  but come on look at american movies  no where close to love story  there was no storyline  does war have a storyline  i think that is a silly criticism  the storyline is this  they start with  men and the movie narrowed down to show the lives of about  men and how each did their part and died  death is the ultimate end to any story  just because there was no happy ending does  mean it has no storyline     there was a horrid truth in this movie  i would  necessarily call it  anti  war   it had a political statement of course  but the movie was  all about the politics  in fact  except for a few occurrences when the captain  showed up  there was never a stifling air of nazi germany  they were far enough out of the reach of the main nazi party  the fat cats were  gon na go into   maybe not completely accurate and not a hollywood hit  but it exhibits a fine knowledge of the common soldier  i  say exactly of almost any nationality and  what they must go through  it was a losing battle  of course the movie is going to be depressing  and to the person who said that it was gutsy  and silly  to even portray germans as victims  there are victims on all sides in every war  any real soldier will tell you   this movie is a fine balance between movie and documentary  a few problems with it when arguing for just one  but it instills the best of both worlds  watch it as such  beware however because it is a hard movie to watch if not graphically     waiting til they make a movie about iraq  it will probably have many of the same themes and will be very controversial  i want to see who has the guts to do it first   jarhead does  count  <pad> ,eventually several people die,0.04232865571975708,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.5719,0.1549227386713028,-0.04232865571975708,eventually several people die,0.06314454972743988,1,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.1921,0.986487090587616,-0.06314454972743988,1,1
