38,9762,i agree with the posters before that the characters were exceptionally strong and believable and all the actors at their top form  i especially loved david boreanaz stretching in a part so unlike anything else he played proving once again his amazing gift for comedy  the first part of the movie was light and funny  the blackmail part was a bit surrealistic but interesting  and it was all downhill from   i found it frustrating that at least two out of the  girls  keira and lisa  get out of the  scot free  nary a trace left on their psyche  i know the movie <unk> the darker ending of the play  and i am not saying i missed the murder part  but i surely needed to see those two getting their comeuppance somehow and i was left groaning in frustration with the ending   it  why i gave it only a   but definitely an interesting film  ,fantastic roving camera angles,0.1970341354608536,1,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.4061,0.215879425406456,-0.1970341354608536,prestigious hollywood award nomination,0.06756806373596191,1,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.3168,0.950012743473053,-0.06756806373596191

41,20039,i feel extremely sad for some of the people who have been reviewing this film  it is apparent that their standards are so high that they will never be able to enjoy a film just for enjoyment sake  or  perhaps  their enjoyment is derived from the act of picking films apart  looking for any reason at all to dislike   the long kiss goodnight is an action film  in every sense of the word  sure  there are holes in the plot big enough to drive a semi through  but none of them are enough to stop the flow of the film itself  i have never been a big geena davis fan  but i was impressed with how she was able to create two very different characters  samantha cain and charlie baltimore  in my opinion  it was  even necessary to have changed her physical appearance to differentiate between the two  her acting was more than enough to do the   more than anything else  though  this film was craig bierko   in another  hands  the character of timothy could  been just another interchangeable villain  his decision to play him with a more casual approach was just the right counterpoint to all of the action scenes  it is  often that you find an actor who can express himself so well with just his facial expressions  point in case  the scene in the freezer with charlie and her daughter  where most films would  cluttered the moment of  revelation  with unnecessary dialogue  bierko  eyes told the whole   the basic plot  thin  to be truthful  a seemingly average housewife who suffers from amnesia slowly discovers that she had been an assassin  as her memory returns  so do the people who want the assassin dead  is she really samantha  the cookie baking housewife  or charlie  the cold blooded assassin  or maybe a little bit of both  for me  the long kiss goodnight was an enjoyable journey to find out  <pad> ,making particularly bad films,0.2566177546977997,1,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.5673,0.13120925426483154,-0.2566177546977997,illegal immigrant feels sick,0.14717736840248108,1,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.4724,0.9847471714019777,-0.14717736840248108

55,19399,ah  when good actors take on bland material  if you are thinking of this movie as a tight police thriller you may be disappointed  while the situations are very true to life  the plot proceeds at a very predictable clip and you can pretty well see what lays ahead way before the actors take you there  many of the criminals and secondary figures are really just stereotypes in motion  much of the dialog is just plain   but  if you love to see good actors rise above this kind of material and make something of it  then you will love this movie  sam elliott is nothing short of illiant in taking the one  note character of detective falon come alive with depth and pathos  those of you who have never seen elliott emote that much beyond his usual scowling stoic stances will be delighted at the range of emotion he depicts in this film  and also  in his early fifties in this film  he looks fantastic  his bare chest scene gives hope to middle aged men everywhere  esai morales does a wonderful job elevating his role as det  falon  eager beaver new police partner  he could have easily played it as a robin to elliott  batman  but instead he eathed a genuineness and passion into this role  he makes it work despite some of the lame lines he is given to   paul sorvino is fun to watch  he plays the eccentric police captain  he seems to know he is slumming in this movie and is having a ball doing it  he makes it fun for us   this movie is very by  the  numbers in plot but makes up for it with great performances  sam elliott fans should definitely get this one as it is suck a kick to see him spread his wings and do so much more than he usually is allowed to do  ,pulitzer prize winning journalist,0.18581542372703552,1,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0224,0.016103826463222504,-0.18581542372703552,respectable affluent rich america,0.00173087976872921,1,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.1743,0.7745171785354614,-0.00173087976872921

57,17749,for those who expect documentaries to be objective creatures  let me give you a little lesson in american film    documentaries rely heavily on casting  you pick and choose characters you think will enhance the drama and entertainment value of your   after you have shot a ton of footage  you splice it together to make a film with ups and downs  turning points  climaxes  etc  if you have trouble with existing footage  you either shoot some more that makes sense  find some stock footage  or be clever with your   the <unk> that the filmmakers used footage of locales not part of the movie  <unk> next to beautiful beaches  does not detract from the value of the film as a dramatic piece and the particular image is one that resonates enough to justify its not  quite  truthful inclusion  at any rate  you use the footage you can  so they did  happen to have police violence footage for that particular neighborhood  does this mean not include it and just talk about it or maybe put in some cartoon animation so the audience is   duped   um    as for the hopeful ending  why not  yes  americans made it  yes  americans are optimistic bastards  but why end on a down note  just because it  set in a foreign country and foreign films by and large end on a down note  let foreigners portray the dismal outlook of   let us americans think there may be a happy ending looming in the future  there just may be one  ,true romantic comedy classics,0.155621737241745,1,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.6455,0.11104845255613327,-0.155621737241745,respectable affluent rich america,0.0009496472775936127,1,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0417,0.906070590019226,-0.0009496472775936127

61,20039,i feel extremely sad for some of the people who have been reviewing this film  it is apparent that their standards are so high that they will never be able to enjoy a film just for enjoyment sake  or  perhaps  their enjoyment is derived from the act of picking films apart  looking for any reason at all to dislike   the long kiss goodnight is an action film  in every sense of the word  sure  there are holes in the plot big enough to drive a semi through  but none of them are enough to stop the flow of the film itself  i have never been a big geena davis fan  but i was impressed with how she was able to create two very different characters  samantha cain and charlie baltimore  in my opinion  it was  even necessary to have changed her physical appearance to differentiate between the two  her acting was more than enough to do the   more than anything else  though  this film was craig bierko   in another  hands  the character of timothy could  been just another interchangeable villain  his decision to play him with a more casual approach was just the right counterpoint to all of the action scenes  it is  often that you find an actor who can express himself so well with just his facial expressions  point in case  the scene in the freezer with charlie and her daughter  where most films would  cluttered the moment of  revelation  with unnecessary dialogue  bierko  eyes told the whole   the basic plot  thin  to be truthful  a seemingly average housewife who suffers from amnesia slowly discovers that she had been an assassin  as her memory returns  so do the people who want the assassin dead  is she really samantha  the cookie baking housewife  or charlie  the cold blooded assassin  or maybe a little bit of both  for me  the long kiss goodnight was an enjoyable journey to find out  <pad> ,making particularly bad films,0.2566177546977997,1,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.5673,0.13120925426483154,-0.2566177546977997,illegal immigrant feels sick,0.14717736840248108,1,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.4724,0.9847471714019777,-0.14717736840248108

67,22268,well we definitely did see and i and many other people were actually expecting worse  it did have some good parts too it that i was not expecting it still did fail in other areas   first off the acting was above average  i love phillip seymour hoffman in this movie and i liked tom hanks  hoffman was the glue to this movie  if it were not for him this movie would have crumbled and hit rock bottom  his performance was by no means stunning but absolutely necessary  he gave a good witty  cynical performance in what most other actors could have easily made his character into a cliché  tom hanks really gave a nice loose performance and did not disappoint but he certainly did not impress  what i could not stand was that julia roberts was involved in this movie  she was as big of a miscast as i have ever seen  for one she is a bad actress  at least to me  she was to young for her character and was to phony even for the character she was   the directing was average to me  i  not really a big fan of the recent mike nichols movies and i  not exactly impressed by this one either  it was made with such a hollywoodish  cartoonish touch hat i could not stand  the worst part about it was that he tried make it be a really meaningful movie at the end  i love meaningful movies but not when a movie tries to rush a scene or two at the end and show something that tries to justify the rest of the garbage spread throughout the whole movie  that is something that mike nichols has seemed to have done a lot in his recent track   the one impressive part of this movie was the writing  the dialog was put together very well and was able to let the story play out  the writing was what was able to really able to take this movie to an above average level  in so many scenes i found myself laughing in part by the   well that is some of what we saw at least  a lot of the scenery was good in the movie if you get what i mean but not a lot other than that  i did like that this movie did not glorify everything america had done  it is obvious that during this whole war in afghanistan the  gave weapons to the people who are now against us  this movie kind of show we are too blame for that  it shows that what may seem good in the short term may turn into something horribly wrong in the future  this movie did have a good original message but it just did not deliver it right  overall though it was entertaining  <pad> <pad> ,special body part helping,0.04982203245162964,1,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.4431,0.2580549120903015,-0.04982203245162964,leslie still look great,0.14486923813819885,1,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.5414,0.9813134670257568,-0.14486923813819885
