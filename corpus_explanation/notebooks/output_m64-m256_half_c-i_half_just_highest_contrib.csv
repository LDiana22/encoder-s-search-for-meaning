2055,10657,i rented this movie without having heard  or read  anything about it  what a shame  this movie is intelligent  witty  hilarious  fast  paced  and realistically ridiculous  the characters manage to get developed without relying too heavily on clichéd  tired stereotypes  it was refreshing to watch  i could  help thinking that marketing would have helped lob this not  so  mainstream movie into the starved  for  intelligent  comedy mainstream  the quality of the dialogue and the ease with which the actors execute a huge range of awkwardness  hearteak and comedy is so rare these days  i felt that the actors must have really enjoyed participating in something this rich  how is it that national treasure was number one at the box office for three weeks in a row  it is so weak in too many ways to mention  i guess i  just happy that movies like  seeing   are still being made somewhere out there  ,prison escapee finds time,0.024541035294532776,1,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.2284,0.271582305431366,-0.024541035294532776,respectable affluent rich america,0.11783498525619507,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.6185,0.9902020096778872,-0.11783498525619507
3230,23866, you ca  take it realistically       zombie bloodbath     is a world all of its own  i  really never seen anything like it  the only thing i can think to compare it to is psychedelic drugs  forgive the  do  simply mean that it  incoherent and absurd  though occasionally it is  i mean that it takes you through such a oad range of intense experiences and unexpected emotions so quickly as to overwhelm you  and when it  over  you find that it  all happened while you were sitting on the   it is worth noting that it  extremely low  budget  as a disclaimer to those who  after seeing  shaun of the dead   consider themselves fans of underground zombie films  also of note is that it is much more  utal  than you  expect  children get disemboweled  and someone taunts a teenage girl before shooting her in the groin  her corpse is subsequently  raped   these are certainly not flaws  and indeed i feel it is to the film  credit  but if it does  sound like your kind of movie  do  waste your    do  mean to over  hype it  regarding utality  do  go in expecting  inside  or something   i hesitate to give away any of the plot  because it  really full of surprises  even the opening scene  which has nothing to do with zombies  is at once a classic horror scene and something quite   man  i  three paragraphs in and i  hardly said anything at all  here  why i thought the movie was awesome    it  big  and it keeps moving  at one point  you expect it to turn into another notld clone  a board  up  the  windows movie where everyone stays in a farmhouse and argues with one another  by the end of the film  however  the farmhouse scenes will seem like a distant dream  there are also a number of outdoor  urban scenes  these are rare in low  budget zombie     the makeup  gore is much better than   more convincing and more creative  something kind of funny  the early zombies look really lame  then  halfway through  they suddenly look really good  with prosthetics and everything  some of them look like fulci zombies  some are reminiscent of  tongue from  day of the dead   and it  got big scenes of dozens of zombies shuffling around  never gets     there  something oddly emotional about it  one character asserts that heaven exists  and that our dead  undead protagonists are now in heaven  in the context of the film  we believe it to be true  though the characters behave with typical horror film stupidity  they genuinely seem to care about each other  and accordingly  i found myself caring about     the pacing is great  there  hardly a dull   my only observation that borders on criticism is that todd sheets comes up with the most bizarre dialog i  ever heard  i personally feel it adds to the experience  but i do  think he does it on purpose  so i ca  fairly give the film a perfect rating   example  when a car eaks down  the owner yells at the passengers  then he says something to the effect of   sorry i yelled at you guys  you do  know what it  like to have your dad standing over you with a straight razor when you  five years old   wtf   at the very end  it gets to be more than i can handle  involves a montage with bill clinton  and then some preachy end credits explaining the zombie metaphor  really  by this point  i was firmly re  living my drug   highly recommended    <pad> ,old unspenseful horror films,0.011740297079086305,1,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.3256,0.05845095589756965,-0.011740297079086305,beloved younger sister nettie,0.11406028270721436,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.7117,0.9912126660346984,-0.11406028270721436
