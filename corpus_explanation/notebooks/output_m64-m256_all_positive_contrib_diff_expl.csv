1,23866, you ca  take it realistically       zombie bloodbath     is a world all of its own  i  really never seen anything like it  the only thing i can think to compare it to is psychedelic drugs  forgive the  do  simply mean that it  incoherent and absurd  though occasionally it is  i mean that it takes you through such a oad range of intense experiences and unexpected emotions so quickly as to overwhelm you  and when it  over  you find that it  all happened while you were sitting on the   it is worth noting that it  extremely low  budget  as a disclaimer to those who  after seeing  shaun of the dead   consider themselves fans of underground zombie films  also of note is that it is much more  utal  than you  expect  children get disemboweled  and someone taunts a teenage girl before shooting her in the groin  her corpse is subsequently  raped   these are certainly not flaws  and indeed i feel it is to the film  credit  but if it does  sound like your kind of movie  do  waste your    do  mean to over  hype it  regarding utality  do  go in expecting  inside  or something   i hesitate to give away any of the plot  because it  really full of surprises  even the opening scene  which has nothing to do with zombies  is at once a classic horror scene and something quite   man  i  three paragraphs in and i  hardly said anything at all  here  why i thought the movie was awesome    it  big  and it keeps moving  at one point  you expect it to turn into another notld clone  a board  up  the  windows movie where everyone stays in a farmhouse and argues with one another  by the end of the film  however  the farmhouse scenes will seem like a distant dream  there are also a number of outdoor  urban scenes  these are rare in low  budget zombie     the makeup  gore is much better than   more convincing and more creative  something kind of funny  the early zombies look really lame  then  halfway through  they suddenly look really good  with prosthetics and everything  some of them look like fulci zombies  some are reminiscent of  tongue from  day of the dead   and it  got big scenes of dozens of zombies shuffling around  never gets     there  something oddly emotional about it  one character asserts that heaven exists  and that our dead  undead protagonists are now in heaven  in the context of the film  we believe it to be true  though the characters behave with typical horror film stupidity  they genuinely seem to care about each other  and accordingly  i found myself caring about     the pacing is great  there  hardly a dull   my only observation that borders on criticism is that todd sheets comes up with the most bizarre dialog i  ever heard  i personally feel it adds to the experience  but i do  think he does it on purpose  so i ca  fairly give the film a perfect rating   example  when a car eaks down  the owner yells at the passengers  then he says something to the effect of   sorry i yelled at you guys  you do  know what it  like to have your dad standing over you with a straight razor when you  five years old   wtf   at the very end  it gets to be more than i can handle  involves a montage with bill clinton  and then some preachy end credits explaining the zombie metaphor  really  by this point  i was firmly re  living my drug   highly recommended    <pad> ,old unspenseful horror films,0.011740297079086305,1,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.3256,0.05845095589756965,-0.011740297079086305,beloved younger sister nettie,0.11406028270721436,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.7117,0.9912126660346984,-0.11406028270721436

3,19399,ah  when good actors take on bland material  if you are thinking of this movie as a tight police thriller you may be disappointed  while the situations are very true to life  the plot proceeds at a very predictable clip and you can pretty well see what lays ahead way before the actors take you there  many of the criminals and secondary figures are really just stereotypes in motion  much of the dialog is just plain   but  if you love to see good actors rise above this kind of material and make something of it  then you will love this movie  sam elliott is nothing short of illiant in taking the one  note character of detective falon come alive with depth and pathos  those of you who have never seen elliott emote that much beyond his usual scowling stoic stances will be delighted at the range of emotion he depicts in this film  and also  in his early fifties in this film  he looks fantastic  his bare chest scene gives hope to middle aged men everywhere  esai morales does a wonderful job elevating his role as det  falon  eager beaver new police partner  he could have easily played it as a robin to elliott  batman  but instead he eathed a genuineness and passion into this role  he makes it work despite some of the lame lines he is given to   paul sorvino is fun to watch  he plays the eccentric police captain  he seems to know he is slumming in this movie and is having a ball doing it  he makes it fun for us   this movie is very by  the  numbers in plot but makes up for it with great performances  sam elliott fans should definitely get this one as it is suck a kick to see him spread his wings and do so much more than he usually is allowed to do  ,pulitzer prize winning journalist,0.18581542372703552,1,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0224,0.016103826463222504,-0.18581542372703552,respectable affluent rich america,0.00173087976872921,1,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.1743,0.7745171785354614,-0.00173087976872921
4,20039,i feel extremely sad for some of the people who have been reviewing this film  it is apparent that their standards are so high that they will never be able to enjoy a film just for enjoyment sake  or  perhaps  their enjoyment is derived from the act of picking films apart  looking for any reason at all to dislike   the long kiss goodnight is an action film  in every sense of the word  sure  there are holes in the plot big enough to drive a semi through  but none of them are enough to stop the flow of the film itself  i have never been a big geena davis fan  but i was impressed with how she was able to create two very different characters  samantha cain and charlie baltimore  in my opinion  it was  even necessary to have changed her physical appearance to differentiate between the two  her acting was more than enough to do the   more than anything else  though  this film was craig bierko   in another  hands  the character of timothy could  been just another interchangeable villain  his decision to play him with a more casual approach was just the right counterpoint to all of the action scenes  it is  often that you find an actor who can express himself so well with just his facial expressions  point in case  the scene in the freezer with charlie and her daughter  where most films would  cluttered the moment of  revelation  with unnecessary dialogue  bierko  eyes told the whole   the basic plot  thin  to be truthful  a seemingly average housewife who suffers from amnesia slowly discovers that she had been an assassin  as her memory returns  so do the people who want the assassin dead  is she really samantha  the cookie baking housewife  or charlie  the cold blooded assassin  or maybe a little bit of both  for me  the long kiss goodnight was an enjoyable journey to find out  <pad> ,making particularly bad films,0.2566177546977997,1,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.5673,0.13120925426483154,-0.2566177546977997,illegal immigrant feels sick,0.14717736840248108,1,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.4724,0.9847471714019777,-0.14717736840248108
5,11653,it could not have come from a different country nor from a different time  this movie simply oozes <unk> influenced late  italian cinema  so  pseudo serious and sexually free  sumptuous settings and dreamy music make this a visual and aural delight  plus we get the lovely dagmar lassander  surely at her very best looking  the kinky goings on make for a wild ride and if the romps amidst the <unk> towards the end seem overlong it is but another rather charming trait of the time  you were probably expected to split those few minutes between the screen and your girlfriend and it does of course herald a twist in the proceedings  it might have been better if philippe leroy did  look quite so odd with his <unk> red hair and twisted facial expression  he does well though and has many silent moments where dagmar is cavorting and he has to show a mixture of love and hate  not an ordinary narrative film by any means but for those who like that something different  this is certainly that  ,jackie gleason type villain,0.2095983922481537,1,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.47600000000000003,0.03880468010902405,-0.2095983922481537,wide white ready grin,0.012415036559104921,1,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0598,0.9752562642097472,-0.012415036559104921
6,11345,for the record  i am a curly fan through and through  but i do have to say that in reality  shemp was  really that bad  yeah  he might have lacked the same kind of slapstick that curly had  but in his own way he was hilarious  at least he was  as bad as joe   in ideless groom  shemp plays a music professor  stooge  a professor  yeah right   who recently inherited a half million dollars from a dead uncle  and moe  larry have to prepare him to marry a woman by six  that night  or no   this was one of the stooges  first skit with shemp  before they started recycling their material  perhaps it is  surprising that shemp was part of the stooges before curly came into the picture  so he seemed natural at this  the slapstick gags are hilarious  especially this one scene with moe and shemp in a phone booth  essential stooge short to be honest  ,strong female role model,0.2021189033985138,1,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.4574,0.2143757343292237,-0.2021189033985138,wide white ready grin,0.00209808349609375,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.9366,0.986967384815216,-0.00209808349609375

8,22537,this sad romance is <unk> because the director decides to eak its narration and to offer the points of view of each characters  so  there are a lot of flashbacks  of re  shooting of the same scene  but  it would be an extraordinary moment of cinema to put all the fragments in order to see the result     and it would worth it  because it  for me  just one the best french movie ever made     it has everything     cast  first steps of monica bellucci and vincent cassel  such a presence and such voices  even for a hard  of  hearing  it  symbolic for them to have fallen in love with this   directing  his camera is ight  alive  plays with the sets or can be mysterious with long close  up  à la david   cinematography  the light is beautiful  between gold and rust  like their   a never  seen before paris  it  a paris out  of  time of more accurately  a composite of a lot of districts  huge search here  it  look like gotham city  modern and old at the same time     music  not the big orchestra but in perfect tune with the frames  and the song of charles <unk> made me discover this great singer     ah   the story  as i said  it  a love story but rather tragic  saying that love can be for nothing  that it does  make all people happy or is  guaranteed for a sweet ending is great because this message is  often told  love is passion  which is derivative from the latin  pain   you can suffer a lot when you are in love  because of the why    of the endless waiting  the lack of courage  the indecision     and when you can ease yourself  fate  destiny  god     devil    can stab you in the back  just because you arrive too soon or too late  and above all  because love means  in a world of billions  a lot of things can happen and as much stories can be written  so  what  love     personally  i lived some moments like this  in a car with the dear one  her mobile rings and you know it  her  special friend  whom she kisses goodbye  and not you  even if we are always together   so  you want to go out of this car to leave them together  to not hear the sweet but cruel words but you ca   because an amazing hard rain just started     i found that this movie depicts those moments of tragedy as no one else  ,really well done honestly,0.039037123322486884,1,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.1392,0.1497669667005539,-0.039037123322486884,respectable affluent rich america,0.14053279161453247,1,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.5459,0.9898040294647216,-0.14053279161453247
